# AtharvaAuti-Cover_protect_and_aimer
The Cover Protect &amp; Aimer is an innovative defensive equipment system designed to enhance soldier safety during combat operations. This system integrates modern electronics with conventional assault rifles to provide a crucial tactical advantage while minimizing exposure to enemy fire.
Technical Architecture
The system consists of three main components:

A rifle-mounted OV7670 camera module
An Arduino UNO microcontroller processing unit
A helmet-mounted TFT display screen

Core Functionality
The system captures real-time video through the rifle-mounted camera and transmits it to the helmet-mounted display, allowing soldiers to:

Observe targets from behind cover
Aim accurately without direct line of sight
Maintain situational awareness while minimizing exposure
Take effective shots from protected positions

Technical Specifications

Video Resolution: VGA compatible
Frame Rate: 10 FPS
Power Supply: 7-12V DC
Operating Voltage: 3.3V (internal)
Interface: I2C for camera configuration
Data Processing: 8-bit pixel data stream
Display: TFT screen with SPI interface

Advantages Over Existing Solutions
